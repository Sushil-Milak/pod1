### Where are my pods?

#### Command to create pods
/Users/sushil/Desktop/repo/login_module/pods/myPod/pod1
pod lib create pod1
make ios development target 16 at all places (targets, Pods project).

create repo at Github or Bitbucket.
For Github.
Create repo. Commit. Put tag. Commit. Once ready for release, DO A RELEASE before creating PUBLIC pod.
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Message"
git remote add origin https://github.com/S**/blah.git ~
git push -u origin master

GIT release

Now publish for pod.
pod trunk register 'your email-id'
pod lib lint podlibrary**.podspec (from the project folder)
pod trunk push podlibrary**.podspec

now pod should be available, if it is public. Need to see how to do for PRIVATE.
We can do local as well.

How to use in other project:
Check the PodFile inside /Pods folder. Use this as a starter
OtherProject: pod init. Update pod file. pod install. pod update.

pod cache clean --all
pod --verbose --allow-warnings --no-clean  lib lint

Questions:
Where to put Firebase dependencies (podspec file or Package).
Trying adding SPM firebase (look inside beneproto podfile )
